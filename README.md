# Bloxd.io-MidnightTexturePack
I'm making a new texture pack, mainly for myself to make the blocks look like how i like them :D
ALSO
UNTIL BLOXD REMOVES THEIR SKIN UPDATE I WILL BE ATTEMPTING TO BRING BACK THE OG SKINS IN THIS TEXTURE PACK

I HATE THE SKIN UPDATE >:|

also i will probably not give this to anyone else except my friends and if you happen to find this in the abyss of github you could use it too lmao
